# Project: DNA Processing

**This project is a collection of small programs for DNA processing and analysis. It includes four main modules:**

1. DNA to RNA Conversion: Converts a given DNA sequence to its corresponding RNA sequence by replacing 'T' with 'U'.

2. RNA Complement: Computes the complement of a given RNA sequence by replacing each base with its complementary base ('A' with 'U', 'U' with 'A', 'C' with 'G', and 'G' with 'C').

3. RNA Identification: Identifies the type of RNA sequence based on the start codon. It identifies if the sequence is mRNA, tRNA, or rRNA.

4. RNA Translation to Amino Acids: Translates a given RNA sequence into a sequence of amino acids using the genetic code table.

**Instructions:**

To use the modules, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile all the necessary files using a C compiler, for example, using gcc.

3. Run the resulting executable to execute the DNA processing programs.

**Usage:**

1. **DNA to RNA Conversion:**
- Input: A DNA sequence (e.g., "ATGCTAGCTA").
- Output: The corresponding RNA sequence (e.g., "AUGCUAGCUA").

2. **RNA Complement:**
- Input: An RNA sequence (e.g., "AUGCUAGCUA").
- Output: The complement of the RNA sequence (e.g., "UACGAUCGAU").

3. **RNA Identification:**
- Input: An RNA sequence (e.g., "AUGCUAGCUAUAG").
- Output: The type of RNA sequence (e.g., 'm' for mRNA, 't' for tRNA, 'r' for rRNA).

4. **RNA Translation to Amino Acids:**
- Input: An RNA sequence (e.g., "AUGUUUUUCUGU").
- Output: The corresponding sequence of amino acids (e.g., "MFPV").

**Notes:**
- The genetic code used for RNA translation is a simplified version, and a real genetic code table contains more combinations of codons and amino acids.
- Please ensure that all files are correctly compiled and executed.
